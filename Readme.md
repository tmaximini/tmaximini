Hi ðŸ‘‹
I am Thomas, a Software Engineer from Germany. I used to live and work in Berlin, then started to travel around Asia for a few years and now I've somehow settled in the german countryside. ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²
I work at [Crowdcast](http://crowdcast.io) where we are building a platform for creators to build communities around live video events. For more information about me, check out my website at [maxi.io](http://maxi.io) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tmaximini).
